    #String Hashing

    To compare two string using string matching by character comparing one by one,
    it requires O(N) time

    We can optimize this to O(1) using a hash function to hash strings.
    Since identical string should have same hash value, we can compare them by comparing 
    hash value in O(1). Collision should be avoided while hashing to get accurate results.
